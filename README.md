What to do---
1. To get the data sets from NLTK and store them in database

2. To make a trie out of these data and then use pickling(object serialization) to put it in a file

3. Whenever the app is on,the file is used to get object and then search goes on 

4. Autocomplete using ternery search trees and spell check using Bk-trees

5. Store meaning,synonyms,examples(everthing from NLTK) in the leaf node itself.
